  <h2>About transitions</h2>
  <p>For simple transition effects, include <name>transition.js</name> once alongside the other JS files. If you're using the compiled (or minified) <name>bootstrap.js</name>, there is no need to include this&mdash;it's already there.</p>

  <h2>What's inside</h2>
  <p>Transition.js is a basic helper for <name>transitionEnd</name> events as well as a CSS transition emulator. It's used by the other plugins to check for CSS transition support and to catch hanging transitions.</p>

  <h2>Disabling transitions</h2>
  <p>Transitions can be globally disabled using the following JavaScript snippet, which must come after <name>transition.js</name> (or <name>bootstrap.js</name> or <name>bootstrap.min.js</name>, as the case may be) has loaded:</p>
{% highlight js %}
$.support.transition = false
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
