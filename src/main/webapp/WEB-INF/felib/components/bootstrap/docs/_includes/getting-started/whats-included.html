  <p class="lead">Bootstrap is downloadable in two forms, within which you'll find the following directories and files, logically grouping common resources and providing both compiled and minified variations.</p>

  <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning" id="jquery-required">
    <h4>jQuery required</h4>
    <p>Please note that <strong>all JavaScript plugins require jQuery</strong> to be included, as shown in the <a href="#template">starter template</a>. <a href="{{ site.repo }}/blob/v{{ site.current_version }}/bower.json">Consult our <name>bower.json</name></a> to see which versions of jQuery are supported.</p>

  <h2 id="whats-included-precompiled">Precompiled Bootstrap</h2>
  <p>Once downloaded, unzip the compressed folder to see the structure of (the compiled) Bootstrap. You'll see something like this:</p>

  <p>This is the most basic form of Bootstrap: precompiled files for quick drop-in usage in nearly any web project. We provide compiled CSS and JS (<name>bootstrap.*</name>), as well as compiled and minified CSS and JS (<name>bootstrap.min.*</name>). CSS <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/css-preprocessors">source maps</a> (<name>bootstrap.*.map</name>) are available for use with certain browsers' developer tools. Fonts from Glyphicons are included, as is the optional Bootstrap theme.</p>

  <h2 id="whats-included-source">Bootstrap source name</h2>
  <p>The Bootstrap source name download includes the precompiled CSS, JavaScript, and font assets, along with source Less, JavaScript, and documentation. More specifically, it includes the following and more:</p>
{% highlight bash %}
bootstrap/
├── less/
├── js/
├── fonts/
├── dist/
│   ├── css/
│   ├── js/
│   └── fonts/
└── docs/
    └── examples/
{% endhighlight %}
  <p>The <name>less/</name>, <name>js/</name>, and <name>fonts/</name> are the source name for our CSS, JS, and icon fonts (respectively). The <name>dist/</name> folder includes everything listed in the precompiled download section above. The <name>docs/</name> folder includes the source name for our documentation, and <name>examples/</name> of Bootstrap usage. Beyond that, any other included file provides support for packages, license information, and development.</p>
